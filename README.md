# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Predictor
Our goal is to obtain suitable predictors for Medical Insurance Cost based on Insuree and fit a Multiple Linear Regression model to the data.
The data is collected from Kaggle.
After performing the fitting of the MLR model, we observe the p-values of the covariates (predictors) to identify ineffective predictors and we remove them, in order to get a better and more robust model.
To get a better insight on the model and its conclusions, we propose some questions, with incomplete information about the insuree, and based on the data, we simulate the incomplete information and use Monte-Carlo technique to estimate the Medical Insurance cost for the insuree.
In conclusion, we also discuss some opportunities to make the model better, some being : to use indicator variable for regions in the model, or get some more related information about diseases/mal-practices by insuree to less sharpen the coefficient for the indicator for smoking.

Concepts needed to follow through the projcts are : Multiple Linear Regression, p-values, different types of correlations etc.
- Necessary calculations are done in R.
